# Website of the Visual+Interactive Data group at the University of Edinburgh

## Adding new publications

-   The publications page is located at [visualinteractivedata.github.io/publications](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/publications).
-   To add a new publication, please follow the instructions in the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_9by7qJYC7DSvtqsNnaNqEeZ2MYKUJj7jMEiL5-7YA/edit#gid=0) located in the `vishub group/website` folder.
-   DO NOT edit the csv directly. **Your changes will be overwritten** as soon as the next person uses the Google Sheet to update the list.

## Adding people

To add a new group member, edit the [`_data/people.json`](_data/people.json) file.

To add a masters student or alumnus, edit the [`people.md`](./people.md) file.

## Adding a project

To add a new project page, create a new `.md` file in [`_projects/](./_projects).

You can also edit [`_config.yml`](./_config.yml) to set the order in which projects are listed on the homepage; projects without a specified position will appear at the end of the list.

## Updating news

To update the news displayed on the homepage, edit the [`news.md`](news.md) file. Add new items at the top of the list, since they are displayed in the order shown in the file.

The homepage shows all items until the `<!-- more news -->` line in between the bullet points. Move this line to where you want the news on the homepage to cut off. The cut off older news will still be available when following the 'More news...' link. 

## How to work on this site locally

-   Make sure you have [Ruby and Jekyll installed](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
-   Clone this repo to your computer
-   Open a command line in that folder, run "bundle update" then "bundle exec jekyll serve"
-   The website should now be available at localhost:4000

_This works on my (Sarah's) Windows setup - cannot vouch for anything else, but this is the general principle of running Jekyll sites locally_

Alternatively, you can run Jekyll inside docker using:

    docker run -v $(pwd):/srv/jekyll -it jekyll/builder jekyll build
